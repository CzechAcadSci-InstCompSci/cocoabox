# Cocoabox

Cocoabox (Complex Connectivity Analysis toolbox) is a library of software modules for modeling and analysis of complex systems, implemented in MATLAB. It makes the analysis of complex systems simple by combining a set of tools for advanced data analysis usually available in separate libraries (dimension reduction, visualisation, estimation of linear and nonlinear dependence, theoretical analysis of graphs, and more). Its modular architecture makes it easily adaptable to the needs of various application areas. 

Future versions will include further modules, as well as additional parameter options for existing modules.

## Requirements
MATLAB. Recommended version: 2020b.

## Usage
To analyse your data within a user interface:
- download `cocoaboxGUI.mlappinstall`
- double-click on the downloaded file to install it
- click on 'cocoabox' in the Apps tab of the MATLAB Toolstrip to open the GUI

For instructions on using the GUI, see the [GUI User Manual](GUI_UserManual.md).

Alternatively, select relevant MATLAB functions and use them in your analyses. The functions are divided into two folders - "Functions_cocoa" and "Functions_external" - and documented directly in their headers.
